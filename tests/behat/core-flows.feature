  Scenario: Participants navigation opens EasyStud and switches all workspaces
    Given I am on the "ES101" "Course" page logged in as "teacher1"
    When I navigate to "Participants" in current page administration
    Then the "#local-groupimport-easystud" "css_element" should be visible
    And I should see "Student One" in the "#local-groupimport-easystud" "css_element"
    And the "[data-easystud-layout-mode='both']" "css_element" should exist
    And the "[data-easystud-layout-mode='participants']" "css_element" should exist
    And the "[data-easystud-layout-mode='structure']" "css_element" should exist
    When I click on "[data-easystud-layout-mode='participants']" "css_element"
    Then the ".local-groupimport-easystud--participant-focus" "css_element" should exist
    When I click on "[data-easystud-layout-mode='structure']" "css_element"
    Then the ".local-groupimport-easystud--structure-focus" "css_element" should exist
    When I click on "[data-easystud-layout-mode='both']" "css_element"
    Then the ".local-groupimport-easystud--participant-focus" "css_element" should not exist
    And the ".local-groupimport-easystud--structure-focus" "css_element" should not exist

  Scenario: Participant density and selection can be changed without mutating course data
    Given I am on the "ES101" "Course" page logged in as "teacher1"
    When I navigate to "Participants" in current page administration
    Then the ".local-groupimport-easystud--compact-users" "css_element" should exist
    When I click on "[data-easystud-density-toggle]" "css_element"
    Then the ".local-groupimport-easystud--compact-users" "css_element" should not exist
    When I click on "[data-easystud-user][data-user-id] > .local-groupimport-easystud-selector" "css_element"
    Then the "[data-easystud-user].is-selected" "css_element" should exist
    And the "[data-easystud-clear-all-selection]" "css_element" should be visible
    When I click on "[data-easystud-clear-all-selection]" "css_element"
    Then the "[data-easystud-user].is-selected" "css_element" should not exist
