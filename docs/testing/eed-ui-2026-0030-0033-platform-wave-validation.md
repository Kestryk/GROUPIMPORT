# EED-UI-2026-0030 to 0033 Platform-wave human validation

## One validation bundle

This is the sole human-validation bundle for the cumulative source candidate:
`EED-UI-2026-0030`, `EED-UI-2026-0032`, `EED-UI-2026-0033`, and the 0030 QA
audit. Do not split it into independent preview requests or run a broader
matrix before this bundle is reviewed.

The exact source-owned scenario is
`platform-wave-0030-0033.spec.js` / `EED-UI-2026-0030-0033 Platform wave:
global controls plus Mass Import and Administration no-script lifecycle`.
It is `local-supervised`: it needs one authenticated Moodle 5.1 runtime but
does not create or edit fixtures, settings, groups, users, cache or data.

## Required sequence

1. On Student Management, review the 0030 controls at 1440 x 1000 then at
   390 x 844: centred enabled and disabled top actions, the `Groups without
   grouping` surface/disclosure, bottom-of-block pagination and compact
   pagination-arrow focus. At desktop, activate Complete (`both`) for
   Participants and the Groupings tree, Participants for Groups Complete,
   then Structure for Groups Structure and the Groupings tree; these panels
   are intentionally hidden outside their owning layout mode.
2. On Mass Import, review its normal JavaScript lifecycle (ready real content,
   no visible loading Skeleton) and then a JavaScript-disabled page (native
   navigation and form are visible; only the decorative Skeleton is hidden).
3. On Administration settings, review its normal JavaScript lifecycle (native
   settings after the bounded loading lifecycle) and then a JavaScript-disabled
   page (native settings are visible; only the decorative Skeleton is hidden).

The bottom pagination remains the final managed child of each paginated list.
Dynamic empty and filtered-empty states are inserted immediately before it, so
late lifecycle updates cannot push the pagination back into the card flow. A
subsequent pagination synchronization also moves an already-existing bottom
navigation back to the final-child position instead of only enforcing this
order when the navigation is first created.

The test uses one browser context for normal lifecycle checks and an isolated
JavaScript-disabled context for both no-script checks. It closes that isolated
context in `finally`; the supervised runner still owns credentials, runtime
lease and external artifacts.

## Required external captures

- `0030-global-controls-desktop.png`
- `0030-global-controls-mobile.png`
- `0032-mass-import-normal-lifecycle.png`
- `0032-mass-import-no-script.png`
- `0033-admin-normal-lifecycle.png`
- `0033-admin-no-script.png`

All captures belong in the external manifest-backed artifact directory, never
in Git. This source-only preparation does not authorize a runtime promotion,
cache purge, browser launch, lease, fixture mutation or human acceptance.
